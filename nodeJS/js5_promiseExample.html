<h1>Promise example - see console!</h1>

<script>
console.log("Creating Promise object");
let myFirstPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // We call resolve(...) when what we were doing made async successful, and reject(...) when it failed.
  // In this example, we use setTimeout(...) to simulate async code. 
  // In reality, you will probably be using something like XHR or an HTML5 API.
  setTimeout(function(){
    resolve("Success!"); // Yay! Everything went well!
  }, 5000);
});

console.log("Setting then method");
myFirstPromise.then((successMessage) => {
  // successMessage is whatever we passed in the resolve(...) function above.
  // It doesn't have to be a string, but if it is only a succeed message, it probably will be.
  console.log("Yay! " + successMessage);
});
</script>
